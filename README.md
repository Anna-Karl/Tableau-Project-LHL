# Final-Project-Tableau

## Project/Goals
To conduct exploratory data analysis on the Airbnb listings dataset in New York City, covering the period from 2008 to 2015. The objective is to uncover and understand the relationships and trends in Airbnb's market development during this time frame. By creating visualizations and dashboards, the project aims to offer a comprehensive view of the data, enabling informed decision-making and enhancing insights into market dynamics.

## Process
### 1. Connect to Data: 
Import data from Airbnb's New York City public data. 

### 2. Explore and Clean Data: 
Analyze data to understand its structure, detect various data types, and remove duplicates and outliers.

### 3. Data Visualization: 
Creating visual representations of data using charts, graphs, and maps. 

### 4. Data Investigation: 
Dive deeper into the data to uncover trends, patterns, and meaningful insights and frame research questions.

### 5. Creating Dashboards: 
Design informative and interactive dashboards that effectively convey data findings. 

## Results
Option 2: Airbnb listings in New York City.

Based on the visualizations and dashboards, it is possible to answer a lot of questions, for instance:
+ What is the average price of each neighborhood over time by zip code? How have the average prices in specific zipcodes changed from 2008 to 2015?
+ How does the average price vary across different neighborhoods in New York? Which neighborhoods have the highest and lowest average prices for example by type of room? 
+ How do the average prices differ among different property types? Which property types tend to have the highest and lowest average prices?  
+ Do specific neighborhoods show significant variations in average prices for private rooms compared to shared rooms? What are the typical average prices for apartments, houses, and condos, and how have they evolved over time?
+  How is the number of new hosts in the Airbnb dataset expected to change over time?
+  Are there neighborhoods with consistently high ratings over the years?
+  What is the typical distribution of listings across neighborhoods, and are there neighborhoods with a particularly high or low percentage of listings? What is the neighborhood with the highest average rating for listings?

Key points:

Manhattan and Brooklyn attract the most listings, popular among tourists.
Bronx, Queens, and Staten Island have more private room listings.
Larger rooms, like entire homes/apartments, command higher bed prices.
Manhattan consistently has the priciest room types.
Zipcodes generally boast positive ratings above 90%.
Average listing prices rose until 2011 and declined in 2012 due to increased listings.
Another price drop in 2014-2015 was likely due to competition and regulations.
    

## Challenges 
1. Generating Creative Charts: Selecting the most suitable chart types for data and objectives required creative thinking to ensure the visualizations convey the desired insights.

2. Dashboard Design Complexity: Creating a clean and efficient dashboard layout was time-consuming and demanding. 

3. Handling Large Data: Some warnings were encountered when trying to load Name due to the number of values.

## Future Goals
1. Further cleaning the data by addressing null values in various fields and columns to improve the data quality and reliability of analysis.

2. Comparing the forecasted trends with real market situations based on data updates to provide insights into the accuracy of predictions.

3. Gathering data on points of interest to investigate how geographical proximity to these places impacts listing prices and popularity.
